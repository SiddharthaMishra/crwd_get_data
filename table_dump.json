These fundamental data structures are useful for unordered data. For example, a hash table provides immediate access to data indexed by an arbitrary key value, that could be a number (such as a memory address for cached memory), a URL (such as for a web cache) or a dictionary. Graphs are used to represent relationships between items, and this course covers several different data structures for representing graphs and several different algorithms for traversing graphs, including finding the shortest route from one node to another node. These graph algorithms will also depend on another concept called disjoint sets, so this course will also cover its data structure and associated algorithms.","picture":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/http://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/d8/42cdc0ab2011e8b910bdf80bed9f6c/CenterILblock-ISQUAREOrangeBackgrnd.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&dpr=1","rating":0,"uniquename":null,"rating_count":0,"courseinfo":{"tags": [], "reviews": [], "comments": []}},

This course familiarizes you with some main theories of international relations, shows how the global order is gradually changing and discusses how selected international and regional organizations contribute to the maintenance of global peace and security. You learn what research findings tell us in terms of the capacity of international organizations and actors to help prevent or stop violent conflict, what tools are used to negotiate agreements and how foundations for sustainable peace are best created. We will also focus on the role of the European Union in terms of diplomacy and efforts to prevent conflict, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the contribution of organizations such as the African Union to the prevention of conflict and war. We will study the United Nations Security Council and see in which ways its membership could be adapted to more accurately reflect the power relations of the current global order. Through quizzes and exercises testing your knowledge of these subjects, you will understand crucial concepts and get insights into how the academic study of international relations and international organization contributes to the search for global stability and peace in practice.","picture":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/http://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/99/be375da761419aa65929074c4fe213/logo-Universiteit-leiden-resized.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&dpr=1","rating":0,"uniquename":null,"rating_count":0,"courseinfo":{"tags": [], "reviews": [], "comments": []}},

Lectures and readings will lay out the fundamental concepts that underpin design as a human activity. Weekly design challenges test your ability to apply those ideas to solve real problems. The course is deliberately broad - spanning all domains of design, including architecture, graphics, services, apparel, engineered goods, and products. The emphasis of the course is the basic design process: define, explore, select, and refine. You, the student, bring to the course your particular interests and expertise related to, for instance, engineering, furniture, fashion, architecture, or products. In prior sessions of the course about half of the participants were novices and about half had prior professional design expertise. Both groups seem to benefit substantially from the course. All project work is evaluated by your peers -- and indeed, you will also be a peer reviewer. This format allows you to see an interesting collection of projects while getting useful feedback on your own project.","picture":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/5e/4003d6fe94ae4089d5daf13129a515/penn-logo.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&dpr=1","rating":0,"uniquename":null,"rating_count":0,"courseinfo":{"tags": [], "reviews": [], "comments": []}},

Humans are natural network scientists, as we compute new network configurations all the time, almost unaware, when thinking about friends and family (which are particular forms of social networks), about colleagues and organizational relations (other, overlapping network structures), and about how to navigate delicate or opportunistic network configurations to save guard or advance in our social standing (with society being one big social network itself). While such network structures always existed, computational social science has helped to reveal and to study them more systematically. In the first part of the course we focus on network structure. This looks as static snapshots of networks, which can be intricate and reveal important aspects of social systems. In our hands-on lab, you will also visualize and analyze a network with a software yourself, which will help to appreciate the complexity social networks can take on. During the second part of the course, we will look at how networks evolve in time. We ask how we can predict what kind of network will form and if and how we could influence network dynamics.","picture":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/66/4d1f6067b511e599c247e28e57110c/Logo-B-for-Coursera.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&dpr=1","rating":0,"uniquename":null,"rating_count":0,"courseinfo":{"tags": [], "reviews": [], "comments": []}},

While there are different approaches to defining a branding strategy, a branding projectâ\u0080\u0099s implementation impacts many departments and their customer-facing activities. In this sense, itâ\u0080\u0099s essential to understand branding efforts in the context of Customer Experience. In this course, we will use a framework - adapted from Customer Journey Mapping - for focusing and organizing students' thinking about the operational implications of their branding projects. Through the framework, we will derive an operational language for aligning activities and measuring impacts across multiple departments and the customer touch points they manage.","picture":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/http://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/c1/7b3f70ad6911e68aeeff5dd478f537/01_ie_Claim_V_300_square.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&dpr=1","rating":0,"uniquename":null,"rating_count":0,"courseinfo":{"tags": ["Employment", "Leadership", "Management", "Customer Experience"], "reviews": [], "comments": []}},

Attention is drawn to specific opportunities afforded by this new field in accelerating materials development and deployment efforts. A particular emphasis is placed on materials exhibiting hierarchical internal structures spanning multiple length/structure scales and the impediments involved in establishing invertible process-structure-property (PSP) linkages for these materials. More specifically, it is argued that modern data sciences (including advanced statistics, dimensionality reduction, and formulation of metamodels) and innovative cyberinfrastructure tools (including integration platforms, databases, and customized tools for enhancement of collaborations among cross-disciplinary team members) are likely to play a critical and pivotal role in addressing the above challenges.","picture":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/a5/b9f3b0ed1911e4b974a91400b6b11f/Yellow-GT-logo-360x360.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&dpr=1","rating":0,"uniquename":null,"rating_count":0,"courseinfo":{"tags": ["Informatics", "Materials", "Statistics", "Data Science"], "reviews": [], "comments": []}},

These nationwide uprisings have transformed into an intense interest from the public around understanding systemic racism and abuse of power. Millions of Americans and people around the world are watching incidents of police violence and excessive force captured on video, but are looking to learn about the inequalities at the root of these incidents. While the calls of  Black Lives Matter protesters to #DefundThePolice are being heard for the first time by many Americans, they are part of a longstanding effort by communities and activists to reinvest in communities rather than policing and prisons.

What did it made, from pottery to metallurgy, from gastronomy to architecture, from art to religion, of a sea a cradle of civilization? Archaeology may help in disentangling such questions, seeking unexpected answers , by tinkering what ancient Mediterranean peoples left buried in the ground.

It means to participate in your society, to connect with others, and to decide, with them, the issues that you face.\n\nIt starts with you.\n\nWe need to learn to talk civilly with each other about the issues of consequence, but are we capable of learning how to speak together, listen together, and decide together?\n\nIn JuryX: Deliberations for Social Change, an experiment in online civic discourse, you are invited to engage with Professor Nesson and others with an understanding that each of us starts from a place of anonymity. Through a series of asynchronous and synchronous online group activities, you will explore a deliberative system by which emotionally charged issues can be discussed.\n\nAlthough you will learn a bit about the history of jury and even serve as a member of a virtual jury for a mock criminal case, this experiment is about active participation in the deliberative process and how you might use that framework to facilitate dialogue within your own affinity group or community.\n\nThe program consists of six modules. Each week, you will learn and apply a new step in a system designed to foster meaningful dialogue. Starting with an introduction to the course’s deliberative framework, you will move from a traditional jury-based application to a live social issue unfolding in real time: the Massachusetts referendum for the “Legalization, Regulation, and Taxation of Marijuana.” As citizens of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts deliberate on this issue, so will you and your JuryX peers. What arguments will shape this debate, and what will the final outcome be?\n\nCan we, civilly, discuss an issue like marijuana regulation?\n\nTwo synchronous small-group online deliberations will be held using Google Hangout. Participation is optional, but highly recommended.\n\nJuryX: Deliberations for Social Change is, ultimately, about the most fundamental of human interactions: communication. By listening, speaking, persuading, and being persuaded, you will learn about yourself and others.\n\nIf you have faith, faith will be given to you.\n\nHonor Code\nHarvardX requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the edX honor code.

The EU is a major global actor in the field of human rights. EU treaties state that human rights are a fundamental value of the Union, which must be a silver thread in all its policies. The EU now acts within an impressive array of competences, and therefore has the potential to impact – positively or negatively – anyone’s human rights.\n\nThis EU and Human Rights course teaches the basics of human rights, placing the EU at the centre of investigation.\n\nWhat factors are key to making the EU a positive or a negative force for human rights? For example, what impact has the economic crisis had on people’s human rights in the EU and the world?\n\tWhich actors, friends or foes, must the EU engage with to successfully promote human rights? Examples include NGOs, businesses, or other international organisations like the Council of Europe or the UN.\n\tWhat is the impact of the EU in key policy sectors? Examples include trade, development, migration, social policy or international crisis management.\nAll of the course activities aim to improve your understanding of how the EU, alone or in combination with other local or global, state or non-state actors, can better promote and uphold human rights worldwide. The course is intended for anyone interested in human rights and the EU, human rights law, European Studies, international relations, global governance, etc. It is divided into four modules:\n\nThe EU and Human Rights: Value Promotion and Coherence\n\tPromoting Human Rights inside the EU\n\tPromoting Human Rights in EU External Action\n\tCapitalising on Success and Remedying Flaws\nThis course is taught by leading academics, and the content is illustrated through interviews of practitioners in the field of the EU and human rights. The course also comprises a wealth of bibliographical resources, and frequent exercises to test what you have learned.\n\nYou can follow the content in sequence or complete modules in order of interest to you. Be aware that it would be realistic to spend 4 to 6 hours on each module. The course will be available from October until the end of February and you can follow your own rhythm in studying and practicing what is offered in each module.\n\nThis MOOC is based on the FRAME project (www.fp7-frame.eu.

The Comedy, which is richly steeped in the medieval culture of the 14th century, still speaks vividly to modern readers struggling with the question, “who am I?” Dante, as a Florentine, a poet, a lover, and religious believer, struggled with the same question in each facet of his life before coming to a moment of vision that wholly transformed him as a person.\n\nAs a 21st century reader, you will encounter the poem in a novel online environment that integrates knowledge from the disciplines of literature, history, psychology, philosophy, and theology with modern technology. You will be guided through the poem by means of the \"MyDante\" Project, an online environment developed by Professor Ambrosio in collaboration with the Georgetown University Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship (CNDLS), which will aid your own contemplative engagement with the poem. Alone and with the edX community, you will reflect on both Dante's interpretation of freedom and how it functions in the formation of personal identity, and the problem of finding appropriate metaphors to discuss these issues in our modern life.\n\nYou, the modern reader, will only understand the full implications of Dante's poetry if you participate with it in a way that is personal and is genuinely contemplative. You will discover that contemplative reading goes beyond the literal meaning, and even beyond the traditional allegorical and interpreted meaning, to apply every possible meaning contained in the text to your own life and identity. Through the MyDante platform, you will learn to know yourself in your own historical, personal, and spiritual contexts as you journey towards your understanding of your personal freedom and identity.","picture":"https://prod-discovery.edx-cdn.org/media/course/image/e97163cb-54d8-421e-83c6-1b55c980dcab.small.jpg","rating":0,"uniquename":null,"rating_count":0,"courseinfo":{"tags": ["Humanities, Literature, Philosophy & Ethics"], "reviews": [], "comments": []}},
 {"id":574,"title":"The Divine Comedy: Dante's Journey to Freedom, Part 2 (Purgatorio)","link":"https://www.edx.org/course/divine-comedy-dantes-journey-freedom-georgetownx-humx422-02x","professor":"Frank Ambrosio","description":"Now I shall sing the second kingdom,there where the soul of man is cleansed,made worthy to ascend to Heaven.-Purgatorio, Canto I, lines 4-6\n\nWhile Hell is “black, confined, stinking, noisy, and suffocating, the great Mountain of Purgatory rises in pure sunlit solitude out of the windswept southern sea.” (Sayers, Purgatorio; Introduction)  Dante has undergone a conversion which has, literally, turned his world upside down.\n\nSadly, the majority of Dante’s readers do not accompany him beyond his escape from the Inferno, in part, perhaps, because of an instinctive anticipation that when the excitement of adventure is over, then the hard work of maturation must begin. Indeed, there is work aplenty on Mount Purgatorio, but there is also so much more. There is day and night, labor and rest, waking and dreaming, all the rhythms of diurnal living; but above all, there is the delight of hope. All that the penitent souls suffer here, they undergo in the eagerness of passionate yearning to be healed of the wounds of sin inflicted on them as part of the universal heritage of humanity. Purgatory is a “school of contemplation,” where the healing of wounds coincides with learning to suffer the weight of responsibility for one’s own identity as a person. For those willing to undertake the steep ascent of Dante’s seven-story Mountain, nowhere in the legacy of human culture is the process of becoming a “whole person” more closely observed or rendered with deeper psychological and social insight than in the cantos of Dante’s Purgatorio.\n\nFor us as modern readers, Mount Purgatorio is a steep ascent indeed, and if fewer of us accept this challenging invitation than do for the careen through Hell, then it should come as no surprise for us to learn of the untold years, centuries perhaps, that the souls whom Dante meets there require to complete their climb. A realistic willingness to suffer consciously and voluntarily, motivated by authentic hope, is hardly recognized as a possibility by most of us today for whom security and prosperity are accepted as the unqualified goals of our striving. Even to consider an alternative of the sort which Dante offers us in the Purgatorio is already a notable achievement, but one which the imaginative power of Dante’s poetry here places within our reach. Do not let the opportunity pass you by.\n\nIn this course, you will be asked to participate in learning activities on both edX and on MyDante, an innovative platform for deep reading that emphasizes mindfulness and contemplative reading habits as key to deriving lasting meaning from poetic texts. We begin on September 28 with an optional reading week. If you have not previously worked with the MyDante platform and are not familiar with the Contemplative Reading approach to the text which it is meant to support, the week offers a chance for you to become acquainted with MyDante and the practice of contemplative reading before we begin the course in earnest on October 5. Equally important, if you have not already read Inferno, we strongly suggest you do so before beginning Purgatorio. It is possible to read, understand and enjoy Purgatorio without having read the Inferno, but it is also true that familiarity with the first part of the journey will increase both your understanding and your enjoyment of the second. Finally, if you were with us for the Inferno, then we urge you to read through the Purgatorio in the reading mode of MyDante, or even as much as you can, during this week. The basic premise of contemplative reading is that re-reading is the best way to read. Try it; we are very sure you will agree.","picture":"https://prod-discovery.edx-cdn.org/media/course/image/42ae6bc0-0b3d-4e15-92fe-f2d8a50d5247.small.jpg","rating":0,"uniquename":null,"rating_count":0,"courseinfo":{"tags": ["Humanities, Literature, Philosophy & Ethics"], "reviews": [], "comments": []}},

Through this class, Journalism for Social Change (J4SC), you will learn the practice of solution based journalism, wherein stories give equal weight to problems and their solutions.\n\nThe goal of this online course is two-fold: 1) to teach you how to use journalism and media as an implement of social change; and 2) to have you become effective change agents yourselves.\n\nThroughout the course, you will view examples of outstanding solution-based journalism. The majority of these stories focus on vulnerable children. The umbrella of children allows us to explore the broad, but deeply interwoven issues affecting all vulnerable peoples.\n\nJ4SC provide you with a platform to research, report on, and write about the policy and justice issues that fuel your own interests and passions, whether that involves immigration crises, criminal justice, women’s rights, child exploitation, or poverty. Student work will be published throughout the semester and have a direct, immediate impact.\n\nThrough precise, rigorous reporting and policy analysis, students will substantively contribute to public discourse, and by virtue of that contribution, drive political will toward positive policy solutions to the myriad social issues that vulnerable peoples across this globe face.","picture":"https://prod-discovery.edx-cdn.org/media/course/image/2111f13d-a0d7-431a-87f5-32c9748a80de-3730022cdecc.small.jpg","rating":0,"uniquename":null,"rating_count":0,"courseinfo":{"tags": ["Communication, Social Sciences"], "reviews": [], "comments": []}},

In this course, you will learn how to interpret the often contradictory ideas about how, why, where and when dogs arose.\n\nGeneticists, archaeologists, anthropologists and behavioral scientists offer a variety of often opposing ideas about how dogs—the first domesticated species—arose. Some place the origin of dogs over 100,000 years ago; others place the start of dogs just 12,000 years ago. Claims for the location of the origin of dogs range from China to Europe and many places in between.

Stark","description":"Statistics 2 at Berkeley is an introductory class taken by about 1000 students each year. Stat2.2x is the second of three five-week courses that make up Stat2x, the online equivalent of Berkeley's Stat 2.\n\nThe focus of Stat2.2x is on probability theory: exactly what is a random sample, and how does randomness work? If you buy 10 lottery tickets instead of 1, does your chance of winning go up by a factor of 10? What is the law of averages? How can polls make accurate predictions based on data from small fractions of the population? What should you expect to happen \"just by chance\"? These are some of the questions we will address in the course.\n\nWe will start with exact calculations of chances when the experiments are small enough that exact calculations are feasible and interesting. Then we will step back from all the details and try to identify features of large random samples that will help us approximate probabilities that are hard to compute exactly. We will study sums and averages of large random samples, discuss the factors that affect their accuracy, and use the normal approximation for their probability distributions.\n\nBe warned: by the end of Stat2.2x you will not want to gamble. Ever. (Unless you're really good at counting cards, in which case you could try blackjack, but perhaps after taking all these edX courses you'll find other ways of earning money.)\n\nThe fundamental approach of the series was provided in the description of Stat2.1x and appears here again: There will be no mindless memorization of formulas and methods. Throughout the course, the emphasis will be on understanding the reasoning behind the calculations, the assumptions under which they are valid, and the correct interpretation of results.\n\nFAQ\n\nWhat is the format of the class?\n\n\tInstruction will be consist of brief lectures and exercises to check comprehension. Grades (Pass or Not Pass) will be decided based on a combination of scores on short assignments, quizzes, and a final exam.\n\t\n\tHow much does it cost to take the course?\n\tNothing! The course is free.\n\t\n\tWill the text of the lectures be available?\n\tYes. All of our lectures will have transcripts synced to the videos.\n\t\n\tDo I need to watch the lectures live?\n\tNo. You can watch the lectures at your leisure.\n\t\n\tWill certificates be awarded?\n\tYes. Online learners who achieve a passing grade in a course can earn a certificate of achievement. These certificates will indicate you have successfully completed the course, but will not include a specific grade. Certificates will be issued by edX under the name of BerkeleyX, designating the institution from which the course originated.\n\t\n\tCan I contact the Instructor or Teaching Assistants?\n\tYes, but not directly.

Imagine the brilliance of its colour in the glass, the ripe fruit aromas on the nose, a hint of toasty oak and lingering tannins on the back palate. Perhaps you like a specific wine, but can’t pinpoint the reason why. The attributes that make wine so enjoyable are achieved through the expertise of viticulturists and winemakers, whose decision-making in the vineyard and winery is underpinned by science – to be precise, viticulture and oenology.\n\nThe finer details can take years to learn, but in a matter of weeks this course will give you a broad understanding of the principles and practices used to grow grapes and make wine, and their impact on wine appearance, aroma, flavour and taste. You’ll also gain an appreciation for how cutting-edge research is helping to secure the future sustainability of the global wine industry. Whether you’re a wine novice or a seasoned oenophile,, this course is for anyone who loves wine and wine tasting. You’ll even get to make your own wine-- virtually at least!\n\nConfidently describe wine appearance, aroma, flavour and taste.","picture":"https://prod-discovery.edx-cdn.org/media/course/image/bad6807d-68fb-4580-9c07-ec255ad7f366-271bb15328bf.small.jpg","rating":0,"uniquename":null,"rating_count":0,"courseinfo":{"tags": ["Chemistry, Food & Nutrition, Science"], "reviews": [], "comments": []}},

Jenkins","description":"The skills you learned in the military will go a long way toward helping you succeed in college, but if you’re looking for some extra support – or an academic tune-up – then you’ll find it in this course. We know that the culture of higher education is different from the culture of the military in meaningful ways, and we also know that one of the keys to excelling in college - especially for student veterans - is learning to navigate these differences successfully, right from the very start.\nThis course aims to help you do just that. First, the course will orient you to the norms and expectations of the college classroom. The quicker you know what is expected of you, the quicker you can start learning. Second, the course will offer you strategies to ease your transition, to help you achieve your academic goals, and to allow you to make the most of your college education.\nWhile this course is open to everyone, the content has been tailored specifically for student veterans currently pursuing higher education, active duty servicemembers who aspire to start school or return to school soon, and higher education professionals who work to support student veterans at their schools. If this sounds like you, and if you’re ready to learn how to make your transition easier and more successful, then we hope you’ll join us.\nThis online curriculum may be used in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, as a start-to finish, self-directed online experience (MOOC). It can also, in its current format, serve as an “orientation” for other student veteran success programs. We also invite you to utilize this resource as a library/toolkit of academic success strategies, a tool for flipped classroom pedagogy, or a companion text for on-the-ground transition courses.\nWe welcome the opportunity to assist higher education institutions (both 2-year and 4-year), military installation education services officers and transition assistance programs, veteran focused non-profit organizations, and more. To get underway, contact us at the Columbia University Center for Veteran Transition and Integration.","picture":"https://prod-discovery.edx-cdn.org/media/course/image/63182838-cdc4-4d16-9a5c-e150cc725ba2-f5b3d7c4ffc7.small.jpg","rating":0,"uniquename":null,"rating_count":0,"courseinfo":{"tags": ["Education & Teacher Training"], "reviews": [], "comments": []}},

In the course of about three weeks, over 600 people died. This incident was, tragically, not unusual in London or the rest of the 19th century world as a whole. The scourge of cholera seemed unstoppable and, even worse, unpredictable. But one doctor -- ignored by the scientific community at large -- set out to prove that he knew how cholera was spread.\n\nJoin us for this one-week, immersive learning experience. We will explore John Snow’s London, from the streets of Soho to the dataset that helped create the map that changed our understanding of cholera and epidemiology forever.\n\nThis course features interactive tools including an interactive ArcGIS map of the 1854 cholera outbreak and a Timeline JS of John Snow’s investigation. \n\nThis module is a part of PredictionX, which looks at the history of attempts to predict the future.

By combining theory and practice, the course not only aims to provide a clear view of the historical development of the music, but also emphasizes the training of aural skills and the accumulation of musical knowledge. The course covers not only classical music, such as neo-classical, expressionism, nationalism and other genres, but also explores in depth jazz, rock, and pop music of the 20th century. While studying Chinese music and other forms of national folk music in the 20th century world music context, students will also analyze large and complex works such as opera, musicals, and film music. By enhancing students’ understanding of 20th century Western music (classical music, pop music, folk music, comprehensive art) as a foundation, three core questions will be addressed: what is music, what is the 20th century Western music, and what is effective listening? The course aims to guide students to examine the three listening modes of 20th century Western music with the hope of forming a diverse and multi-faceted, knowledge and understanding of the 20th-century Western music culture phenomena, expanding students’ horizons, enhancing their ability to reason by analogy, and promoting cross-disciplinary, creative development.\n\nThe course is one of the PKU-DeTao MOOCs, which is a joint effort by Peking University and DeTao Masters Academy. 该课程是“北大-德稻网络开放课程”中的一门，由北京大学与德稻教育联合提供。\n\nHow can I get access to reading materials?\n\nPlease download the materials from designated websites.

Please submit them to the specified mailbox after completion.\n \n\n如何完成课后作业？\n课后作业依照情况而定，分为文字作业和聆听作业，完成后直接提交到指定邮箱。\n\nWhat will the exams be like for this course?\n\nThe exams will be open-book written assignments.\n\n如何考试？\n考试将采取开卷考试方式，根据不同学生群体情况，或以论文形式，或以在线考试，或以作业完成情况最终确定成绩。\n\nHow will scores be calculated?\n\nThe grading weights will vary per topics and tasks. Generally, all students can pass the course by completing all specified assignments. The passing score will be primarily decided by the final exam. \n\n考试成绩的计算？\n不同学期课题，不同学习任务，教师将及时调整考试成绩的计算方式。一般情况，在完成课程所指定任务的前提下，学生可以百分之百通过考试。分数确定主要以期末考试为主，期中考试是否举行，以情况而定。\n\nCan I submit graded assignments late? \n\nNo.如果考试方式是论文，是否允许延迟上交？\n绝对不允许。\n\nHow can I best engage with online learning for this course?\n\nApart from the questions gained from the micro lectures, students can also get their questions answered via e-mail, and have access to the discussion forum and online interest groups.\n\n在线学习如何进行？\n课程所提供的课前短课视 频系必读内容，在课后阅读、课后作业和课后聆赏完成过程中，产生的所有问题将被汇总，由教师或以文字邮件的方式或以视频短课录制的方式做出回答。此刻，教 师将根据学生的问题及时安排在线答疑、在线讨论，并发挥网络教学的便利，建立课程讨论区，组织兴趣小组\n\nWhat is the role of the on-campus class for this course?\n\nThe on-campus course will serve students who can attend the class for lectures, which are then recorded and released online.\n\n教师课堂面授的作用？\n为服务可以出席面授的学生，本课程将在在线学习之外，安排固定时间固定长度的教师课程面授，教学活动将被录制，在线发布，以保证在线学习学生的需求。\n\nWill I fail to keep up in the course due to my lack of understanding about the field of music?\n\nOur content is adjusted to a general audience. \n\n课程是否会因在音乐领域积累不足而无法跟进？\n教师依照课程核心，一方面给出清晰课程线索，跟进不难，另一方面，教师尽可能调整课程内容，照顾到全体情况。根据以往的经验，课程结束，同学均可跟进课程标准，且不乏各样收获。\n\nAre there content knowledge pre-requisites for this course?\n\nAn earnest desire to learn and a proactive, professional attitude are more important than prior knowledge of content matter. The learners are expected to absorb the basic content points quickly and use them as a base for further learning.\n\n课程内容秉持怎样的上课标准？教师保持一贯上课理念，认为专业，关于态度，不关乎知识，不会因同学不同程度，顾左右言其他，忽略最核心最关键知识点及问题的涉及。\n\nWhich is more important for this course, knowledge or ability?\n\nThis course is most concerned on the development of music listening ability, though some knowledge of music will be helpful. \n\n课程重视知识还是能力？\n课 程最关心音乐聆听能力的发展，在提供行之有效聆听技术的同时，安排适当知识内容的传授。加之考试不重知识，而重能力，因此，课程中因教室光线不足而造成无 法做太多笔记，恰恰是教师所希望的。课后传发同学的曲目说明，其中所标出的知识点，所指系能力而非知识。在音乐领域，所谓历史是听觉样本，即艺术品本身积 累起来的，而非人名和作品名串联起来的。艺术史，是感觉的历史，不是文字描述的历史。\n\nWhat is the aim of the music puzzle assignment within the course?\n\nThe purpose of the assignment is to prepare and develop audiometry and memory skills.\n\n课程所谓音乐拼图作业的目的是什么？\n作 业的目的，在于听觉甄别力和记忆力的筹备与发展。相当于我们小时候玩得拼图或积木游戏，从局部观察到整体把握，这一训练所形成的对线条、形状、色泽等构成 物的甄别与记忆，不仅是视觉所需，也是发达听觉所必备。多数情况下，类似课程作业的练习，在中国音乐课程中，很少会有。之所以课程一开始便这样做，是因为 知道学生听觉的普遍问题。不少同学在实践之初，会遇到困难，这很正常，如果没有做好接受困难的准备，也就不必来此课程分享，也就不必来北大读书了。\n\nWill the course provide information about music composition and technology?\n\nNo. Music composition mastery requires long-term training, usually at a conservatory level.\n\n课程是否可能或可以提供关于作曲的知识与技术？\n课 程不可能在作曲方面给予单独帮助，通过目前的教学方式，尽管正在探索，教师只能也必须照顾到最大多数同学的需求，这一难处，是客观的，请多谅解。关于作曲 四大件的技术发展，在音乐学院有一套完整的训练程序，乐理是入门，和声是基础，二者建立关于调性音乐系统的初阶。随后的复调写作，作曲系耗时约需一年甚至 更多，根据全面仿作练习，帮助同学发展多声思维和多声部操控技术。配器是第三梯度，约需一年时间完成，全面掌握乐队法。曲式分析，是封顶收官之课。将之前 所有梯队课程的内容，一并总结。\n\nWill the course be available in English?\n\nThe videos in the course will include English subtitles. However, the rest of the course content will only be available in Mandarin.\n\n这门课程使用英语授课吗？\n视频中教师使用中文授课，有英文字幕，但是课程的其他内容，如阅读、作业题、讨论等都只用中文。","picture":"https://prod-discovery.edx-cdn.org/media/course/image/ff3cce8b-61a0-4998-90e1-db75dc88d249-b8a8ec862b35.small.jpg","rating":0,"uniquename":null,"rating_count":0,"courseinfo":{"tags": ["Humanities, Music"], "reviews": [], "comments": []}},

We will focus on this basic topic of the human habitat in a holistic way, and introduce possibilities of participatory urban design by citizens, leading towards the development of a citizen design science.\n\nYou will be able to share your experiences with the other participants in the course and also with the experts from the teaching team. In completing this course, you will better understand how to make a city more livable by going beyond the physical appearance and by focusing on different properties and impact factors of the urban system.\n\nLivability in Future Cities is the second course in a series of MOOCs under the title “Future Cities.” This series aims to bring the latest research on planning, managing and transforming cities to places where this knowledge has the highest benefit for its citizens. “Future Cities” provided an overview, and this course will focus on livability in existing and new cities.","picture":"https://prod-discovery.edx-cdn.org/media/course/image/bfb22790-ad70-404f-bed2-b6adf0a9f5b2-77e4352d2765.small.jpg","rating":0,"uniquename":null,"rating_count":0,"courseinfo":{"tags": ["Architecture"], "reviews": [], "comments": []}},
 {"id":632,"title":"Future Cities","link":"https://www.edx.org/course/future-cities-ethx-fc-01x","professor":"Gerhard Schmitt","description":"Understanding a city as a whole, its people, components, functions, scales and dynamics, is crucial for the appropriate design and management of the urban system. While the development of cities in different parts of the world is moving in diverse directions, all estimations show that cities worldwide will change and grow strongly in the coming years. Especially in the tropics over the next 3 decades, it is expected that the number of new urban residents will increase by 3 times the population of Europe today. Yet already now, there is an extreme shortage of designers and urban planners able to understand the functioning of a city as a system, and to plan a sustainable and resilient city. To answer questions like: Which methods can contribute to the sustainable performance of a city, and how can we teach this to the next generations, the ETH Future Cities Laboratory in Singapore has produced over the last 3 years many necessary research results. “Future Cities” aims to bring these latest results to the places where they are needed most.\n\nThe only way to better understand the city is by going beyond the physical appearance and by focusing on different representations, properties and impact factors of the urban system. For that reason, in this course we will explore the city as the most complex human-made “organism” with a metabolism that can be modeled in terms of stocks and flows. We will open a holistic view on existing and new cities, with a focus on Asia. Data-driven approaches for the development of the future city will be studied, based on crowdsourcing and sensing. At first, we will give an overview of the components and dynamics of the future cities, and we will show the importance of information and information architecture for the cities of the future. The course will cover the origins, state-of-the-art and applications of information architecture and simulation. “Future Cities” will provide the basis to understand, shape, plan, design, build, manage and continually adapt a city. You will learn to see the consequences of citizen science and the merging of Architecture and information space. You will be up-to-date on the latest research and development on how to better understand, create and manage the future cities for a more resilient urban world.","picture":"https://prod-discovery.edx-cdn.org/media/course/image/f9b1916f-8e27-4357-a94b-7a292ca95d40-f7a4549681b9.small.jpg","rating":0,"uniquename":null,"rating_count":0,"courseinfo":{"tags": ["Architecture"], "reviews": [], "comments": []}},

This course introduces the two primary methods used to determine the geometrical structure of molecules: molecular spectroscopy and gas electron diffraction.\n\nIn molecular spectroscopy, molecules are irradiated with light or electric waves to reveal rich information, including:\n\nMotions of electrons within a molecule (Week 1),\n\tVibrational motions of the nuclei within a molecule (Week 2), and\n\tRotational motions of a molecule (Week 3).\nIn the gas electron diffraction method, molecules are irradiated with an accelerated electron beam. As the beam is scattered by the nuclei within the molecule, the scattered waves interfere with each other to generate a diffraction pattern. In week 4, we study the fundamental mechanism of electron scattering and how the resulting diffraction images reveal the geometrical structure of molecules.\n\nBy the end of the course, you will be able to understand molecular vibration plays an important role in determining the geometrical structure of molecules and gain a fuller understanding of molecular structure from the information obtained by the two methodologies.\n\n \n\nFAQ\n\nDo I need to buy a textbook?\n\nNo, you can learn the contents without any textbooks.

It will give you a unified overview of mechanics that will dramatically increase your problem-solving ability. It is open to all students who meet the prerequisites (see right), but is especially designed for teachers and students who want to improve their existing understanding of mechanics.\n\nNewtonian mechanics is the study of how forces change the motion of objects. This course begins with force, and moves on to straight-line motion, momentum, mechanical energy, rotational motion, angular momentum, and harmonic oscillators. Optional units include planetary orbits and a unit whose problems require multiple concepts to be applied to obtain one solution.\n\nNOTE: New Section “Problem-solving Pedagogy”\n\nWe have developed a special approach to organizing the physics content knowledge and for applying it when solving problems.  This approach is called “Modeling Applied to Problem Solving” and has been researched carefully and has proven effectiveness for improving students’ performance in a later physics course on Electricity and Magnetism.\n\nIf you are a teacher looking to improve your knowledge of mechanics, or to learn new approaches to teach your students, we encourage you to sign up in the special teacher section featuring a discussion forum for teachers to discuss teaching ideas and techniques related to the topics discussed in this course.  To join these discussions,  verify yourself as a teacher, and we will sign you up in the teacher forum.\n\nNote that this forum is exclusively reserved for teachers, so please do not register if you are not a teacher.\n\nTeachers in the United States, and especially in Massachusetts, can receive extra benefit from this course. We offer Professional Development Points (PDPs) at no charge to teachers in Massachusetts who complete our course. If you are in a different state, we instead offer Continuing Education Units through the American Association of Physics Teachers. There is a fee for this certificate.\n\nCourse Syllabus\n\nNote: Taking this Course Involves Using Some Experimental Materials\n\nThe RELATE group that authors and administers this course is an education research group, dedicated to understanding and improving education, especially online.  We showed that 8.MReV generated slightly more conceptual learning than a conventionally taught on-campus course  - but we were unable to find exactly what caused this learning.   (So far this is the only published measurement of learning in a MOOC).  This summer we will be comparing learning from different types of online activities that  will be administerered to randomly assigned sub-groups of our students.  At certain points in the course, new vs. previously used sequences of activities will be assigned to different groups.  We will then use common questions to compare the amount learned. Which group receives the new activities will be switched so that neither group will have all new activities.\n\nOur experimental protocol has been approved by the MIT Committee on Use of Human Subjects.  As part of this approval we have the obligation to inform you about these experiments and to assure you that:\n\nWe will not divulge any information about you that may be identified as yours personally (e.g. a discussion post showing your user name). \n\tThe grade for obtaining a certificate will be adjusted downwards (from 60%) to compensate if one group has harder materials.\nNote: By clicking on the registration button, you indicate that you understand that everyone who participates in this course is randomly assigned to one of the groups described above. \n\nWelcome, and we hope you will both learn from and enjoy this course.\n\nFAQs\n\nIs there a required textbook?\n\nYou do not need to buy a textbook. All material is included in this edX course and is viewable online. If you would like to use a textbook with the course (for example, as a reference), most calculus-level books are suitable. Introductory physics books by Young and Freedman, Halliday and Resnick, or Knight are all appropriate (and older editions are fine).\n\n \n\nWhat if I take a vacation?\n\nThe course schedule is designed with this in mind! Course contents are released four weeks ahead of the deadline, so even if you have a four-week vacation, you do not need to miss any deadlines and can still complete all of the material.\n\n \n\nWill I get a certficiate?\n\nYes! This course awards certificates to all who satisfactorily complete the required portion of the course.\n\n \n\nHow are grades assigned?\n\nThere are three parts of the course that are worth points: Checkpoint problems that are folded in with the reading, Homework problems that come at the end of each unit, and Quizzes that are at the end of every 1-2 units. Each is worth a varying number of points, and you will not have to do every problem.\n\nThe course consists of 11 required units and three optional units. You do not need to complete the optional units in order to receive a certificate.\n\nThere is no final exam.","picture":"https://prod-discovery.edx-cdn.org/media/course/image/b8135646-a121-4d43-b336-5cecfbc48388-48516fd4c194.small.jpg","rating":0,"uniquename":null,"rating_count":0,"courseinfo":{"tags": ["Engineering, Physics, Science"], "reviews": [], "comments": []}},
 {"id":649,"title":"Advanced Introductory Classical Mechanics","link":"https://www.edx.org/course/advanced-introductory-classical-mitx-8-mechcx-0","professor":"David E. Pritchard","description":"This college-level, calculus-based Introductory Newtonian Mechanics course covers all of the topics and learning objectives specified in the College Board Course Description for Advanced Placement®Physics C (Mechanics). It covers Newton’s Laws, Kinematics, Energy, Momentum, Rigid Body Rotation, and Angular Momentum. The course covers applications of these basic principles to simple harmonic motion, orbital motion, and to problems that involve more than one basic principle. These principles also underlie the 12 online laboratory activities.\n\nOur emphasis is on helping students learn expert-like ways of solving challenging problems, many of which are similar to problems on previous Advanced Placement Examinations in Mechanics C. We stress a key insight: mechanics is about forces changing motion. We apply this concept to organizing the core knowledge in a way that helps students apply it to sophisticated multi-concept problems. We feel this is the best way to prepare students for success not only on the AP Examination but also in other college-level science, technology, engineering and math courses that emphasize problem-solving.\n\nIf you are a teacher looking to learn better ways to teach your students, or are interested in using some of our MOOC materials in your own classroom—possibly as a private online course for your students—we strongly encourage you to sign up for our teacher’s discussion cohort, a “private discussion room” for teachers to share pedagogical ideas and instructional techniques.To join these discussions, verify yourself as a teacher by clicking this link, and we will enroll you in the teacher’s discussion cohort.\n\nFAQ\n\nHow long is this course?\n\nThe course consists of 13 weeks of required (graded) material and 2 weeks of optional (ungraded) material. You do not need to complete the optional weeks in order to receive a certificate, but we strongly encourage you to complete these units, especially if you are preparing for the College Board’s AP Physics C: Mechanics exam.\n\nIs there a required textbook?\n\nYou do not need to buy a textbook. A complete eText, including worked-examples and some video lectures, is included in this edX course and is viewable online. If you would like to use a textbook with the course (for example, as a reference), most calculus-level books are suitable. Introductory physics books by Young and Freedman, Halliday, Resnick, & Walker, or Knight are all appropriate (and older editions are fine).\n\nMy physics is a little rusty. How should I prepare for this course?\n\nIf you would like to brush-up on basic mechanics skills before taking this course, we recommend the brief warm-up course, On-Ramp to AP Physics C: Mechanics. \n\nWhat if I take a vacation?\n\nThe course schedule is designed with this in mind! Course content is always released at least 3 weeks ahead of the deadline, providing you with the opportunity for flexibility in scheduling.\n\nHow are grades assigned?\n\nThere are five parts of the course that are worth points: (1) Checkpoint problems are incorporated into the reading; (2) most weeks have an interactive lab component; (3) more involved homework problems occur at the end of each week and (4) quizzes at the end of every 1-2 weeks; (5) the course culminates in a final exam. Each category is worth a varying number of points; and you are allowed several attempts on each problem. A final grade of at least 60% is needed for certification; hence you will not have to do every problem.\n\nNote: Taking this Course Involves Using Some Experimental Materials\n\nThe RELATE group that authors and administers this course is a physics education research group. We are dedicated to understanding and improving education, especially online. In one of the only published studies measuring learning in a massive open online course (MOOC), we showed that a previous iteration of this course produced slightly more conceptual learning than a traditionally taught on-campus course. Currently, we are working to find just what caused this learning.  \n\nIn this course, the RELATE group will be comparing learning from different types of online activities that will be administered to randomly assigned sub-groups of course participants. At certain points in the course, new vs. more traditional sequences of activities will be assigned to different sub-groups. We will then use common questions to compare the amount of associated learning. Which group receives the new activities will be switched so that all groups will have some new activities and some traditional ones.\n\nOur experimental protocol has been approved by the MIT Committee on Use of Human Subjects. As part of this approval we have the obligation to inform you about these experiments and to assure you that:\n\nWe will not divulge any information about you that may be identified as yours personally (e.g. a discussion post showing your user name). \n\tThe grade for obtaining a certificate will be adjusted downwards (from 60%) to compensate if one group has slightly harder materials.\nNote: By clicking on the “Enroll Now” button, you indicate that you understand that everyone who participates in this course is randomly assigned to one of the sub-groups described above.","picture":"https://prod-discovery.edx-cdn.org/media/course/image/32706cf3-e263-4a64-97e8-f2bf258bae86.small.jpg","rating":0,"uniquename":null,"rating_count":0,"courseinfo":{"tags": ["Physics, Science, Engineering"], "reviews": [], "comments": []}},

Immunology has a long history, and researchers around the world faced with the “enemies of human life” have solved numerous immunological mysteries, and contributed to a paradigm shift in immunology. Nonetheless, it is as yet unknown how certain diseases like AIDS, influenza and allergies can be completely conquered. The latest immunological research is revealing that immunity is also strongly correlated with an increasing number of other diseases such as cancer, arteriosclerosis and diabetes. If we could fully understand the mechanism of immunity, we should be able to treat such diseases. We would like to introduce basic knowledge of immunology revealed by past research and share our insights on the latest findings with you for the future development of immunology.\n\nDuring this course you will learn the mechanisms of the immune system and deepen your understanding of forefront immunology research and development of medical applications.

We start to wonder about the world around us, asking questions like: “How do certain people become billionaires when others are homeless? Why do humans worship Gods or form families? What makes killing in war acceptable but not in any other situation?”\n\nIf you have ever wondered about these issues and/or other, you aren’t alone. Similar questions have been asked since the beginning of history, and searching for objective answers using scientific research is the goal of sociology. \n\nThis course is designed to look critically and analytically through different sociological perspectives, including the functionalist, interactionist, conflict and feminist, to help us realize the extent to which society guides our thoughts and actions. The course material provides a fresh, new look at societies and cultures—more objective, full of inquiry and analysis, striving towards social justice and change. Sociology urges us to draw connections between public issues and personal problems, to see the strange as familiar and the familiar as strange, and to examine biography in a historical and social context.\n\nIssues of inequalities, social class, race, sexual orientation, disability, age and gender are critically examined within a global perspective in this course. You do not need any prior knowledge of sociological theories or methods to take this class.  Bring your life experiences and knowledge, and see how the Sociological Imagination will allow you to dispel cultural myths and reframe reality.This course will cover topics found on the CLEP Sociology exam.","picture":"https://prod-discovery.edx-cdn.org/media/course/image/ff856625-8261-4a59-9e0e-f2293e137c5f.small.jpg","rating":0,"uniquename":null,"rating_count":0,"courseinfo":{"tags": ["Social Sciences"], "reviews": [], "comments": []}}
